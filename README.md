# AccessForge

Welcome to Access Forge! Access Forge is an authorization solution for Ruby On Rails. It is lightweight, flexible, and extendable.

Simply include a helper in you controller, create a policy with the same base name as your controller, and write some authorization logic for your actions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'access_forge'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To release a new version of this gem, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
